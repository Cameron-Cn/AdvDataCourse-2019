Data Storytelling -- Miriam Gilbert | "Storytelling With Numbers"
    [] Build a data sculpture
    [] Deconstruct a data visualization
    [] Fill in a spreadsheet (on paper)
    [] Sketch a story
    [] Ask good questions
    [] Try to convince me (infographics)
    [] Data storybook (using a crayon, few words)


    How do we define stories in business?
        Accounts of (real or imaginary) events that engage listener {Swift: "proper words in proper places", Said 1982}
        Data stories -- combine narrative with data to make easily accessible and coherent (visuals common)
                defn: a method of delivering messages derived from complex data analysis in a way that allows audience to quickly and easily assimilate the material, understand its meaning and draw conclusions from it. (basic comms theory)
        1. Need a message: hypothesis, angle, importance (a direction!)
        2. Narrative, A -> B -> ???; structure and flow, coherency; visual communication, pictures etc.

    expressiveness, precision, accuracy
       Meaning, level of detail, correctness of data
       
    graphs and tables are most common visuals -- and can be excellent when used correctly
       graphs are relationships within/between data
       tables are good to have reader look up the data for a specific X
      
    Gestalt theory:
        the whole is different from the sum of its parts (perception is influenced by appearance, not by building blocks)
        REMOVE THE CLUTTER

USAID Issues
	Beyond the structural remains of a colonial power:
[] Planet graphics don't scale
[] 10 % of Chile big animals are women, 40% are men...the other 50%
[] no water
[] not realy global?
[] the only call to action is "If women were MORE productive the world would benefit"
	which is obvious??
[] The title is somewhat disconnected from the sudden second half of the graphic
