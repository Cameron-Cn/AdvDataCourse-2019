#### Naming and Nomenclature
    Notes from class are named as `notes_{week}.{day}.txt`
    Exercises from class are named in the order we completed them: `exercise{#}_{name}.ipynb`
    Other projects should be self-evident, including `final_project` and its preceding kin.

#### Disclaimer
    These projects and notes were completed for a class--they are not incredibly advanced, beautiful, elegant,
    or intented for distribution and display. Code is avaiable under the GPL3.0, which means you are free to
    copy, remix, or share as you see fit--provided you use a similar shareable, non-commercial license.
    
#### The Learning Curve
    I enjoy programming--learning languages, techniques, and that thrill of finally hunting out bugs and seeing your code 
    run 'as intended.' 
    As rewarding as creation is, it can be a source of endless frustration and general malaise. Learning is often expensive,
    whether monetarily or through the time-cost building fluency takes.
    All that is to say learning data analysis has been incredibly rewarding--languages both human and silicon fascinate me,
    and gaining competency in the latter is increasingly necessary in a high-tech world. 
    
   For anyone who has questions about projects herein--feel free to reach out.
